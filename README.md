# Made With

-   HTML and Javascript
-   ReactJS
-   CSS with Sass
-   Webpack

# Note

-   This project was originally done in pure Javascript, and for the sake of time, I did not
    make the React components as small as they could be. This resulted in some components being clunkier and
    not as reusable as they should be.

# What I learned from this project

## ReactJS

-   Converted the original Javascript code into React
-   Used props and state to create an interactive web application

## Module Pattern

-   Separated the program into smaller component for easier debugging and testing

## Responsive Web Design

-   Created a website that works on screens of all different sizes

## Accessibility

-   Used rem to ensure people with different base font sizes can still access the page

## Using Packages

-   Utilized the date-fns package to process and format dates

## localStorage and JSON

-   Utilized JSON and localStorage to save user's projects and tasks

# To run on local computer

    1. Clone the repo
    2. Change the working directory to the repo
    3. run npm install
    4. run npm run build
    5. Load the website from the dist directory

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
